I am still working on...
29JAN
1) Creating the color screen to reflect the color of my LED
	-stuck with syntax and understanding of how to get window to change colors

31JAN 2000
1) Code works with following exceptions:
-Green on LED light is not reflected on LED Mirror
-Have to attempt to run the code multiple times before it works due to faulty data causing it to crash on startup

31JAN 2115
Code works completely, solved above solutions by...
1) adding a try-except statement for both index and value errors
2) add QUIT feature so you can just exit out of the LED Mirror and the program will stop running
